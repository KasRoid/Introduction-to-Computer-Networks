# Designing a Network

- More than assembling hardware and software
- You must consider:
  - Capacity
  - Response time
  - Throughput
  - Ease of use
  - Reliability
  - Security
- Must be designed to fulfill the needs of the business and its end-users.
- You must custom tailor your design per the required and/or desired user requirements.

## Network Design Process

Step 1: Identify the uses of the network
Step 2: List which tasks execute on which computers
Step 3: Select the type of network - Centralized or not
Step 4: Select the proper equipment
Step 5: Draw the network
Step 6&7: Write the specifications & build it

## Step 1: Identify the Uses of the Network

- This aligns with our network planning phase
- Need to determine why the organization needs a network
- Find out via interviews:
  - The organization's core business (What do they do?)
  - How they want to change & improve business operations (How can a network help the business?)
- You want to interview the owners, executives, managers, operations staff, etc.
- The more you find out about hte business, the better!

## Step 2: List Which Tasks Execute on Which Computers

- Know which applications and tasks have to be performed at each of the computers on the network
- You need to know how powerful each computer should be and what each computer should be capable of (CPU, RAM, HD Space, Monitor Size)
- This goes for both server and client computers
- Example: A computer for data entry versus a computer for video editing

## Step 3: Select the Type of Network - Centralized or Not?

- Will a peer-to-peer network suffice or do you require a client-server architecture?
- Types of servers services:
  - File server, print server, email server, application server, web server, database server, authentication server, backup server, and so forth.
  - In-House Physical Server(s) or Cloud-based Infrastructure as Service(IaaS)?
    - Multiple Physical Servers In-House or a Single Server Utilizing Virtualization?
    - Utilization of a Cloud Provider: Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, etc.?

## Step 4: Select the Proper Equipment

- Determine what networking equipment is right for the custom-tailored network design.
- Consider everything you had done so far:
  - Identified the Uses of the Network
  - Identified what tsk is done on what computer
  - Peer-to-Peer or Client/Server architecture selection
- Also consider:
  - Monetary Constraints
  - Reliability, Security, Availability, and Scalability Requirements

### Cloud Computing

- Software as a Services (SaaS)
  - Office 365
  - SharePoint Online
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - Microsoft Azure
- Cloud-Based Data Storage & Backups
  - Microsoft OneDrive
  - DropBox
  - iCloud
- Concern: Security, HIPPA-Certified, PCi-DSS, etc.

### Draw the Network

- By the time you reach this step, you should know the following:
  - The purpose of the network
  - The specifics of the network's use
  - The number of users and computers
  - Whether the network will be centralized or not
  - The network topology
- In this step, you want to draw the physical and logical design:
  - Physical layout of IT equipment (blueprint)
  - Logical layout of IP addressing schema
