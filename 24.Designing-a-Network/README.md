# Designing a Network

- More than assembling hardware and software
- You must consider:
  - Capacity
  - Response time
  - Throughput
  - Ease of use
  - Reliability
  - Security
- Must be designed to fulfill the needs of the business and its end-users.
- You must custom tailor your design per the required and/or desired user requirements.

## Network Design Process

Step 1: Identify the uses of the network
Step 2: List which tasks execute on which computers
Step 3: Select the type of network - Centralized or not
Step 4: Select the proper equipment
Step 5: Draw the network
Step 6&7: Write the specifications & build it

## Step 1: Identify the Uses of the Network

- This aligns with our network planning phase
- Need to determine why the organization needs a network
- Find out via interviews:
  - The organization's core business (What do they do?)
  - How they want to change & improve business operations (How can a network help the business?)
- You want to interview the owners, executives, managers, operations staff, etc.
- The more you find out about hte business, the better!

## Step 2: List Which Tasks Execute on Which Computers

- Know which applications and tasks have to be performed at each of the computers on the network
- You need to know how powerful each computer should be and what each computer should be capable of (CPU, RAM, HD Space, Monitor Size)
- This goes for both server and client computers
- Example: A computer for data entry versus a computer for video editing
