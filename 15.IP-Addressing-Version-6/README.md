# IP Addressing Version 6

## Disadvantages of IPv4

- Not enough IPv4 Addresses
  - Approximately 4.3 billion public IP addresses
  - 7.8 billion world population
  - Multiple devices per user (computers, tablets, smart phones, smart TVs, home automation, etc.)
- Less Efficient Routing (compared to IPv6)
- Security is Optional
  - Encrypted data is optional

## IPv6 Solutions

- Plethora of Addresses
  - 128-bit binary address space compared to 32-bit for IPv4
  - 340 trillion trillion trillion addresses
  - 5 x 10^28 addresses for each person on the planet
- Simplified Internet Routing Tables
  - IPv6 packet header enables more efficient routing
    - Fixed at 40 Bytes versus IPv4 "Variable Length" Packet Header for Optional Fields
- Easier & Automated Configuration Compared to IPv4
  - Stateless Auto-Configuration
  - No need for a DHCP server
- Security is Required
  - Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) is required.
    - Source IP can be authenticated
    - Data in transit is encrypted

## IPv4 vs. Ipv6

|                     | IPv4        | IPv6      |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Deployed            | 1981        | 1999      |
| Address Size        | 32-Bit      | 128-Bit   |
| Number of Addresses | 2^32        | 2^128     |
| Addressing          | Class-Based | Classless |

## Why is IPv4 Still Around?

- Subnetting / CIDR
- Use of Private IP Addresses
- Network Address Translation(NAT)
