## Virtual Private Network (VPN)

- A virtual private network (VPN) allows you to remotely connect to a private network or the Internet in a secure, encrypted manner.
- Once connected to the Internet with a VPN client, a tunneling protocol is used to create a protected tunnel through the Internet to the VPN server.
- Tunneling basically means encapsulating one protocol within another to ensure that a transmission is secure.

### VPN Services

- A VPN service encrypts your Internet usage, provides online anonymity, and can trick your service (Netflix, Amazon) into thinking you're in a different location.

### Business Types of VPN

- Remote Access VPNs (Client-to-Site)
  - Allows employees to securely connect to an organization's internal network remotely through the use of VPN client software installed on their machine.
- Site-to-Site VPNs (Intranet VPNs)
  - Allows an organization to securely connect two or more remote sites together over the Internet.
