# Overview of Computer Networks

## What is Network?

A network is nothing more than "two connected computers sharing resoureces with one another"

It is composed of two main aspects

- Physical connection
  - Wires
  - Cables
  - Wireless media
- Logical Connection
  - Data transporting across the physical media

## Basic Computer Networking Rules

- The computers in a network must use the same procedures for sending and receiving data. We call these **communication protocols**.
- Data must be delivered **uncorrupted**.
- Computers in a network must be capable of determining the origin and destination of a piece of information.
  - IP and Mac Address

## Types of Networks (by Size)

- Personal Area Network (PAN)
  - Ultra small networks used for personal use to share data from one device to another
  - Examples
    - Smart Phone to Laptop
    - Smart Watch to Smart Phone
- Local Area Network (LAN)
  - A computer network within a small geographical area, such as a single room, building or group of buildings.
  - Examples
    - Home Network
    - Small Office Network
- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
  - A LAN that's fully dependent on wireless connectivity
  - Most home networks are WLANs
- Campus Area Network (CAN)
  - A computer network of multiple interconnected LANs in a limited geographical area, such as a corporate business park, government agency, or university campus.
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
  - A computer network that interconnects users with computer resoureces in a city.
  - Larger than a campus area network, but smaller than a wide area network.
- Wide Area Network (WAN)
  - A computer network that extends over a large geographical distance, typically multiple cities and countries.
  - Examples
    - The internet
    - Google Offices in Different States

## Peer-to-Peer vs. Client-Server Architecture

Peer-to-Peer

- All Computers on the network are peers
  - No dedicated servers
  - There's no centralized control over shared resoureces
- Any device can share its resoureces as it pleases
- All Computers can act as either a client or a server
- Easy to setup, and common in homes and small businesses

Client-Server

- The network is composed of client and servers
  - Servers provide resoureces
  - Clients receive resoureces
- Servers provide centralized control over network resoureces(files, printers, etc.)
- Centralizes user accounts, security, and access controls to simplify network administration
- More difficult to setup and requires an IT administrator
