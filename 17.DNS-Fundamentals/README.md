# DNS Fundamentals

## Domain Name System Overview and Hierachy

- DNS provides TCP/IP name resolution services, which is the process of translating host and domain names into their corresponding IP address(and vice versa).

## Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQND)

- An FQDN is used to uniquely identify a host on the Internet, such as my website, www.InstructorAlton.com
- Composed of three components:
  - Host Name: www
  - Domain Name: InstructorAlton.com
  - Top-Level Domain: .com
